This version of the prototype produces csv tables for Nodes, Links, and Pipes that can be uploaded into ICPR4

TransformerV2.atbx is the toolbox which can (or should) be uploaded into an ArcGIS pro project. It contains MasterScriptV2. 

MasterScriptV2.txt is the python code that does all the work. If for whatever reason TransformerV2 can't be placed into a project, the code from this file
can be copied and pasted into a newly made toolbox. Note that doing this will require the user to add parameters to the script. They will need to add three
parameters that take a feature layer as input and are set to optional.
