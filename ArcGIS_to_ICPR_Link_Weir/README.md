# Notes
* File handling is wrong and need fix but should work...have more than usual nodes/links due to handling null values.
* i think it can be replicated to other csv like link pipe, link drop structure and more.
* compare with project from Links, you export csv from ICPR by 1D Hydraulics -> Weir Links... -> Menu -> CSV Export.
* my output are _Link_Weir_Shape.csv and _Link_Weir.csv; target is from export csv from ICPR project called Link_Weir_Shape.csv and Link_Weir.csv.
# Setup
* after using that Feature Vertices to Points tool, all vertices, not sures its all or not, you use that as param0 as feature layer, input.
