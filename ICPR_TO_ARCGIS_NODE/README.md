# ICPR to ARCGIS_NODE Notes:
* CSV to ShapeFile...don't know how to do feature layer yet.
* Using the Links folder older file on Florida SouthWest Collegiate HighSchool, not Avon Park. 
* Spatial reference: 2882, it looks like it works, may need to change depending where in florida
* Types didn't fully transfer since we don't know what it means yet. Rest is just increment and hopefully no changes. 
# Parameter setup:
